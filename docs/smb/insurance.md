# Insurance Agency

Covers: independent insurance agents, captive agents (State Farm, Allstate, Farmers), insurance brokers, benefits consultants.

## Pages

- **Products** — Auto, home, renters, life, business/commercial, umbrella, health, Medicare supplements. Organized by personal and commercial. Brief descriptions of each, not policy details.
- **About** — Agent bio, carrier appointments (which companies you represent), community involvement, years in business. Independent agents should emphasize choice — "we shop multiple carriers for you."
- **Get a quote** — Quote request form: type of insurance, basic info, contact. Keep the form short — complex quoting happens by phone or in the carrier system. The form captures the lead.
- **File a claim** — Links to each carrier's claims process, main claims phone numbers. Clients look for this when something bad has happened — make it easy to find.
- **Client resources** — Policy change requests, certificate requests, payment links, carrier login pages. Reduce phone calls for routine tasks.
- **Testimonials** — Trust is central to insurance. Reviews from long-term clients.
- **Blog** — Seasonal risk reminders, coverage explainers, local risk factors.
- **Contact** — Phone, email, hours, appointment scheduling.

## Design

**Visual mood:** Approachable but credible. Warm professionalism — clients need to feel safe and confident, not intimidated. The design should say "we'll take care of you."

**Color direction:** Blues, greens, and warm grays. A touch of warmth to avoid feeling corporate. Avoid stark or cold palettes. Earth tones as accents work well for independent agents.

**Typography feel:** Humanist stack (Segoe UI / Roboto) for approachability and warmth. Heading weight 600. Friendly but not casual — insurance is a trust business.

**Layout emphasis:** Quote request CTA is the primary conversion — keep it prominent on every page. Carrier logos build credibility for independent agents. Claims links need to be easy to find when something bad has happened. Use Pattern 2 (hero + content) for home. Max-width 56rem.

**Photography style:** Family and lifestyle stock photography is acceptable here — insurance is about protecting what matters. Local community photos are even better. Avoid staged corporate imagery. Warm, natural lighting.

**Key component:** Coverage comparison cards or quote request form. Comparison cards show product types (auto, home, life, business) with brief descriptions and "get a quote" CTAs. The quote request form should be short — name, insurance type, contact info — complex quoting happens offline.

## Tools

- **Agency management systems** (Applied Epic, HawkSoft, EZLynx, AMS360) — Core agency systems. Never suggest replacing these. The website links to client portals if available.
- **Cal.com** (open source, free tier) — Appointment scheduling for policy reviews.
- **Buttondown** (open source) — Policy renewal reminders, seasonal tips newsletters.
- **Map listings** — Critical for local insurance agents. Claim the business on Google Business Profile, Apple Business Connect, and OpenStreetMap. Most clients find agents through local search. See `docs/webmaster.md` → Map listings.
- Most agencies have a carrier-provided or vendor website. Independent agents may want something better — that's the Anglesite opportunity.

## Compliance

- **State licensing**: Insurance agents and agencies must be licensed in every state where they sell. Display license numbers. Individual agent licenses are public record.
- **Carrier appointments**: Agents can only sell for carriers they're appointed with. If listing carriers, only list those you're actively appointed with.
- **E&O (Errors & Omissions)**: Professional liability insurance for agents. Not displayed on website but essential.
- **Advertising regulations**: State insurance departments regulate advertising. Don't guarantee coverage, don't make misleading comparisons, don't use "lowest price" claims unless substantiated.
- **Privacy (GLBA)**: Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires a privacy policy for financial institutions, including insurance agencies. Must be prominently linked.
- **Medicare-specific rules**: If selling Medicare supplements or Medicare Advantage, CMS marketing guidelines are strict. No unsolicited contact, specific disclaimers required, scope of appointment rules.
- **Do Not Call**: Insurance telemarketing is regulated. Not a website item, but quote form submissions don't constitute consent to unlimited calls — note your contact practices.
