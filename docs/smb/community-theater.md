# Community Theater & Performing Arts

Covers: community theater companies, community orchestras, dance companies, choral groups, arts councils, comedy troupes.

See [nonprofit.md](nonprofit.md) for shared nonprofit traits (donate page, transparency, compliance).

## Pages

- **Current season** — Shows, concerts, or performances with dates, times, venue, brief descriptions, and poster/promo images. This is the homepage during an active season.
- **Buy tickets** — Direct link to ticketing platform. Should be reachable in one click from any page.
- **Auditions** — Upcoming auditions with dates, requirements, what to prepare, how to sign up. Keep this updated — stale audition info looks bad.
- **About** — Company mission, history, artistic leadership, board
- **Get involved** — How to participate: perform, crew/backstage, volunteer (ushers, set build, costumes), join the board
- **Past productions** — Archive with photos and cast lists. Builds credibility and community pride.
- **Education / classes** — Acting classes, youth programs, workshops, summer camps
- **Donate / sponsor** — Show sponsorships, season sponsors, individual donations, planned giving
- **Venue** — Address, parking, accessibility, seating chart, box office hours
- **Blog / news** — Rehearsal diaries, director's notes, cast spotlights, season announcements

## Design

- **Visual mood:** Creative, vibrant, and inviting. The website should feel like the lobby of a theater — energetic, warm, and promising a great experience.
- **Color direction:** Rich, theatrical colors — deep reds, purples, and golds. These can be bold without being overwhelming. Avoid cold or muted palettes that drain the drama.
- **Typography feel:** Classic serif headings (Georgia stack) for dramatic, traditional theater; Modern stack (system-ui) for contemporary or experimental companies. Bold heading weights to capture the stage presence.
- **Layout emphasis:** Pattern 2 (hero + content) for the home page with a production photo hero. Current show and "Get Tickets" prominently above the fold. Max-width 48rem for narrative pages, wider for season grid layouts.
- **Photography style:** Production photography, rehearsal shots, and cast portraits. 16:9 for show photos and hero images, 1:1 for headshots. Well-lit, capturing the energy and emotion of live performance.
- **Key component:** Current season lineup — show poster or image, title, dates, brief tagline, and ticket link. This is the reason most people visit the site.

## Tools

- **Ludus** (~$0.50/ticket, proprietary) — Ticketing designed for performing arts. Seating charts, box office, patron management. ludus.com

## Compliance

- **Licensing and royalties**: If performing copyrighted works (musicals, plays), licensing is handled by the company (MTI, Samuel French/Concord, etc.), not the website. But do NOT publish full scripts, lyrics, or copyrighted music on the website.
- **Photo rights**: Production photos may involve photographer contracts. Credit photographers on the website.
- **Minor performers**: If youth participate, follow the same child safety policies as youth organizations (consent for photos, background checks for adults).
- **Venue accessibility**: Note ADA accessibility — wheelchair seating, assisted listening devices, accessible restrooms. Required for public venues.
- **Content warnings**: For shows with mature themes, note content advisories on the show page. Audiences appreciate transparency.

## Content ideas

Show announcements with teaser images, director's notes or dramaturg essays, cast and crew spotlights, audition announcements, behind-the-scenes rehearsal photos, opening night recaps, season announcements, education program highlights, donor and sponsor recognition, "why live theater matters" pieces, throwback features from past seasons.
