## Design

**Visual mood:** Encouraging, professional, and approachable. The site should feel like a great teacher — knowledgeable, warm, and invested in your success.

**Color direction:** Warm blues, greens, and bright accents. Inviting without being childish (even for children's programs). Avoid dull or institutional colors.

**Typography feel:** Humanist stack (Segoe UI/Roboto) for approachability and readability. Friendly and clear.

**Layout emphasis:** Services or subjects, scheduling, and contact above the fold — parents and students want to know what you teach and how to get started. Pattern 2 (hero + content) for the home page, Pattern 4 (card grid) for subjects and services. Max-width 56rem.

**Photography style:** Bright learning environment photos, tutor-student interactions, engaged faces. Show the teaching relationship. 4:3 aspect ratio.

**Key component:** Subject or service card — subject name, brief description, levels offered (beginner through advanced, or grade ranges), and a scheduling link. Clear and actionable.

## Tools

- **Cal.com** (open source, free tier) — Session scheduling with recurring appointments. Good for tutors.

- **Square Invoices** (free, proprietary) — For collecting payment. Simple invoicing.
- **Video conferencing** — For online sessions. Link from the website. **Jitsi Meet** (open source, free, no account required — meet.jit.si), **Zoom** (free tier, proprietary), or **Google Meet** / **FaceTime** depending on what the student uses.
- **Monica CRM** (open source, free) — Track students and parents.
- For driving schools: look into **ScheduleOnce** or similar for multi-instructor, multi-vehicle scheduling.

## Compliance

- **Background checks**: Mention if instructors have passed background checks. Parents expect this. Not always legally required, but it builds trust.
- **Child safety**: If working with minors, note any policies (no 1:1 sessions without parental awareness, open-door policy, etc.).
- **Credentials**: Display relevant certifications, teaching licenses, or degrees. For driving schools: state-issued instructor license numbers.
- **FERPA (US)**: Generally doesn't apply to private tutors, but don't collect or display student grades or educational records on the website.
- **Online sessions**: Note privacy practices for recorded sessions if applicable.
