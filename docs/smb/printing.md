# Printing & Signage

Covers: print shops, sign makers, screen printers, embroidery shops, custom apparel (t-shirts, hats, uniforms), promotional products, large format printing, vehicle wraps, banner and decal shops, engraving shops, trophy and award shops. See also [artist.md](artist.md) for custom design studios and [retail.md](retail.md) for shops that primarily sell finished goods.

## Pages

- **Services** — Everything you offer, organized by category: business printing (cards, letterhead, forms, envelopes), marketing materials (flyers, brochures, postcards, posters), signs (yard signs, banners, window graphics, vehicle wraps, monument signs), apparel (screen printing, embroidery, heat transfer, DTG), promotional products (pens, mugs, bags, stickers), specialty (engraving, trophies, plaques, wide format). Each service should note minimum order quantities and typical turnaround.
- **Portfolio / gallery** — Photos of completed work. Organize by category. Vehicle wraps, storefront signs, custom t-shirts, business card designs, event banners. Before-and-after for sign installations. This is the page that sells — show the range and quality.
- **How to order** — The process from start to finish. File submission requirements (formats accepted, resolution, bleed, color mode), proofing process, turnaround times, delivery/pickup options. For sign shops: site survey, design, permitting, fabrication, installation timeline.
- **File guidelines** — Technical page for designers and returning customers: accepted file formats (.pdf, .ai, .eps, .png), minimum resolution (300 DPI for print, 150 DPI for large format), color space (CMYK for print, Pantone for screen printing), bleed requirements, template downloads if available. This saves back-and-forth on every order.
- **Request a quote** — Form with: project type, quantity, size, colors, material preferences, deadline. Upload field for artwork. The quote request form is the primary conversion tool. Keep it simple — don't require fields you don't need.
- **About** — Shop history, team, equipment capabilities, certifications. "Family-owned since 1987" or "union shop" are differentiators. Show the shop and equipment — customers want to see where their work is produced.
- **Blog** — Design tips, material comparisons, project spotlights, industry trends, seasonal marketing tips for businesses. "How to prepare artwork for screen printing" is evergreen search content.
- **Contact** — Phone, email, address, hours, directions. Walk-in vs. appointment. Parking. Note if the shop has a front counter or is production-only.

## Design

**Visual mood:** Industrial-creative hybrid. Bold, practical, slightly technical — the site should feel capable and professional, like walking into a well-equipped shop. Not flashy, not sterile. Confident and no-nonsense, with just enough personality to show there are craftspeople behind the machines.

**Color direction:** Strong primary color (red, blue, or black) paired with white. High contrast, clean backgrounds. The palette should feel like the shop's brand — workmanlike and reliable. Avoid pastels or trendy gradients. Product photos provide the visual interest; the design stays out of the way.

**Typography feel:** Modern stack (system-ui sans-serif). Medium-bold headings (600), medium body weight (400–500). Readable and professional. Service descriptions and technical specs (file guidelines, pricing) need clear hierarchy. Nothing decorative — this is a business that values precision.

**Layout emphasis:** Product showcase and quote request form prominent on every relevant page. Home page leads with capabilities and a strong CTA to request a quote. Use Pattern 2 (hero + content) for the home page with a work sample as the hero, Pattern 4 (card grid) for the services/products pages. Quote request accessible from everywhere. Max-width 64rem.

**Photography style:** Product close-ups showing print quality, material texture, and color accuracy. Consistent lighting on a clean background. Before-and-after shots for sign installations and vehicle wraps. 1:1 aspect ratio for product grid cards. Wider shots (16:9 or 3:2) for installation and project showcase photos.

**Key component:** Product/service card with sample image, brief description, and a prominent "Request Quote" CTA. Each card represents a service category (business cards, banners, vehicle wraps, custom apparel) and links to a detail page or triggers the quote form with the category pre-selected.

## Compliance

- **Sign permits**: Most municipalities require permits for permanent exterior signs. The sign shop often handles permitting as part of the job, but the property owner or tenant is the applicant. Note on the website: "We handle sign permits for most jurisdictions in the [area]." Permit requirements vary wildly by municipality — size limits, lighting restrictions, height limits, historic district rules.
- **Vehicle wrap regulations**: Most states allow vehicle wraps, but some municipalities restrict wraps on commercial vehicles (window coverage, reflective materials). Note any known restrictions for the service area.
- **Zoning for sign installation**: Some areas restrict sign installation businesses to commercial/industrial zones. If the shop does off-site installations, verify contractor licensing requirements.
- **Copyright and trademark**: The shop may be asked to reproduce copyrighted logos, images, or trademarked materials. The shop should verify that the customer has rights to reproduce the material. Note on the website or in the order form: "Customer certifies they have the right to reproduce all submitted artwork."
- **OSHA and chemical safety**: Screen printing involves chemicals (inks, solvents, emulsions). OSHA compliance for ventilation, PPE, and chemical storage. Not a website concern, but worth knowing.
- **Sales tax**: Custom printing may or may not be taxable depending on the state and the type of product. Some states tax finished goods but exempt services. Consult a tax advisor.

## Content ideas

Project spotlights with photos (with client permission), material comparisons (vinyl vs. coroplast, screen print vs. DTG, matte vs. glossy), file preparation tips, design trends, seasonal product promotions (graduation banners, election yard signs, holiday cards, team uniforms), customer success stories ("how a new sign increased foot traffic"), equipment and process behind-the-scenes, tips for choosing colors and fonts, community event sponsorships, trade show recaps, staff spotlights.

## Key dates

- **Election season** (varies, especially Sep–Nov in even years) — Yard signs, banners, bumper stickers. The biggest rush for many sign and print shops. Start promoting early.
- **Graduation season** (May–Jun) — Custom banners, lawn signs, announcements, party decorations.
- **Back to school** (Aug–Sep) — Team uniforms, spirit wear, school event printing.

- **Trade show season** (varies) — Banners, booth graphics, promotional giveaways. Often planned months in advance.
- **Small Business Saturday** (Saturday after Thanksgiving) — Local business promotions. Cross-promote with other local businesses.
- **Spring sports** (Mar–May) — Team uniforms, tournament banners, sponsor signs.
