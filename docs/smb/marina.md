## Pages

- **Services** — What the marina offers: slip rental (seasonal and transient), boat storage (wet, dry, indoor, outdoor), fuel dock, pump-out station, launch ramp, haul-out, winterization, shrink-wrap, detailing. Group by category. Pricing or "call for rates" depending on the business.
- **Slip and storage availability** — Current openings for seasonal slips, transient docking, and storage. Waitlist info if full. Slip sizes and amenities (power, water, WiFi). Update regularly during booking season.
- **Boat sales** — If dealing: current inventory with photos, specs, price, and condition. Filter by type (pontoon, fishing, ski, sail, PWC). Each listing is its own page or entry. Used boats move fast — keep the page current.
- **Boat service and repair** — Services offered (engine repair, fiberglass, electronics, bottom paint, rigging), brands serviced, certifications (Yamaha, Mercury, etc.), turnaround times. Winter service packages.
- **Rentals** — If renting boats, kayaks, jet skis, pontoons: fleet with photos, capacity, rates (hourly, half-day, full day), what's included (fuel, life jackets, cooler), age and license requirements, booking link.
- **Charter and guide** — If offering charter fishing or guided trips: trip types (half-day, full-day, overnight), target species by season, group sizes, what to bring, what's provided, captain bio and credentials, photos of catches. If charters are a major part of the business, see [tour-guide.md](tour-guide.md) for deeper guidance.
- **About** — Marina history, the team, waterway info (lake, river, bay, ocean), facilities and amenities (showers, laundry, ship store, restaurant, pump-out, WiFi). Photos of the property. Aerial or drone shots are especially effective for marinas.
- **Local waters** — Fishing reports, local waterway maps, ramp locations, navigation tips, tide charts (coastal), lake conditions, fish species by season. This page drives organic search traffic and positions the marina as the local authority.
- **Events** — Fishing tournaments, boat shows, rendezvous, cookouts, kids' fishing derbies, sailing regattas, paddle events.
- **Contact / directions** — Address, phone, GPS coordinates (essential — many marinas are hard to find by street address alone). Directions by water and by road. VHF channel if monitored.

## Design

**Visual mood:** Nautical, relaxed, outdoorsy. The site should feel like a day on the water — clean air, blue sky, rocking boats. Professional but laid-back, not corporate.

**Color direction:** Blues, whites, sandy tans. Rope and wood textures as accents. Navy or ocean blue as primary, sandy warm as accent. White background. Avoid anything landlocked or overly bright.

**Typography feel:** Classic stack (Georgia serif) for a traditional maritime feel, or modern stack (system-ui) for a cleaner, contemporary marina. Heading weight 600–700. Readable and no-nonsense.

**Layout emphasis:** Slip availability and services above the fold — boaters want to know if there's room and what you offer. Home page uses Pattern 2 (hero + content) with a waterfront panorama. Services organized as a clear list or grid. Max-width 56rem.

**Photography style:** Water, boats, and dock photography. Aerial and drone shots of the marina layout are especially effective. Sunrise and sunset shots on the water. 16:9 for hero images, 4:3 for services and facilities. Real marina, real boats — not stock.

**Key component:** Services list with rates and seasonal availability — a structured display of what the marina offers (slips, storage, fuel, launch, repair) with pricing or "call for rates" and seasonal notes. Boaters comparison-shop marinas on services and price.

## Compliance

- **USCG regulations**: Charter boats carrying passengers for hire must comply with US Coast Guard regulations. The captain needs an Operator of Uninspected Passenger Vessels (OUPV/"Six-Pack") license for up to 6 passengers, or a Master license for larger vessels. Display the license number on the website.
- **State boating regulations**: Vary by state — boater education requirements, age restrictions for operators, registration requirements, PWC laws. Note relevant state laws on the rental page.
- **Environmental compliance**: Marinas must comply with Clean Water Act provisions — pump-out stations, fuel spill prevention, stormwater management, clean marina certifications. If the marina has a "Clean Marina" certification from the state program, display it prominently — it's a trust signal.
- **Liability and insurance**: Boat rentals and charters carry significant liability. Require signed waivers before departure. Note on the website: "All renters must sign a rental agreement and liability waiver." Verify insurance coverage for all activities offered.
- **ADA accessibility**: Docks and facilities must meet ADA requirements where applicable. Note accessible features on the website: accessible docks, parking, restrooms, boarding assistance.
- **Alcohol regulations**: If the ship store sells alcohol or the marina hosts events with alcohol, state and local liquor licensing applies.
- **Seasonal operating permits**: Some marinas on public waterways operate under permits from the Army Corps of Engineers, state DNR, or local authorities. These may restrict activities or hours.

## Content ideas

Fishing reports (weekly during season — anglers search for these), catch photos (with angler permission), seasonal service reminders (winterization, spring commissioning, bottom paint), boating safety tips, local waterway guides, weather and water conditions, boat show previews and recaps, new boat model announcements, customer boat spotlights, marine wildlife sightings, historical waterway stories, dock life photos, sunset/sunrise shots, tournament results, kids' fishing derby recaps, "how to" articles (docking, anchoring, trailering, knot tying).
