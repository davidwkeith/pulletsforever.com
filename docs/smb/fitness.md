## Design

**Visual mood:** Energetic, motivating, strong. The site should make visitors want to move. High energy without being aggressive — welcoming intensity that says "you belong here, let's go."

**Color direction:** Bold, high-contrast palette — black or dark charcoal as the base with a bright accent (orange, red, or electric blue). White text on dark backgrounds for hero sections. The accent color drives CTAs (join now, try a class). Avoid muted or pastel tones — they undercut the energy.

**Typography feel:** Modern stack (system-ui sans-serif). Heavy weight headings (700–800) for impact. Bold, confident, and unapologetic. All-caps headings work well for class names and CTAs.

**Layout emphasis:** Class schedule and membership/trial CTA above the fold. Make it easy to see what's happening today and how to start. Use Pattern 2 (hero + content) for home with a high-energy photo, Pattern 4 (card grid) for the class lineup. Max-width 64rem.

**Photography style:** Action photos of real members and trainers — mid-workout, not posed. Show the gym environment, the community, the effort. 16:9 for hero and environment shots, 1:1 for trainer portraits. Authentic energy over stock fitness photography.

**Key component:** Class schedule grid or weekly timetable — days as columns, time slots as rows, color-coded by class type. Each cell shows class name, time, instructor, and a link to book or drop in.

## Tools

- **Momoyoga** (~$32/mo, proprietary) — Built for yoga studios. Scheduling, payments, member management. momoyoga.com
- **Zen Planner** (~$99/mo, proprietary) — Gym and studio management. Members, billing, scheduling. zenplanner.com
- **Cal.com** (open source, free tier) — For personal trainers doing 1:1 session booking.

- Many studios already use MindBody or ClassPass. If it's working, integrate with it rather than replacing it.

## Compliance

- **Waivers**: Most fitness businesses require liability waivers. Link to a digital waiver form (many scheduling tools include this). Don't collect health information on the website itself.
- **ADA**: Physical accessibility info is important — mention wheelchair access, shower facilities, parking. Not just for compliance but for welcoming all members.
- **Auto-renewal disclosure**: If memberships auto-renew, pricing pages should clearly state the terms. Some states have specific auto-renewal disclosure laws.

## Content ideas

Weekly or monthly class schedule highlights, new class announcements, instructor spotlights, member transformation stories (with consent), wellness tips (nutrition, recovery, mobility), workshop or special event announcements, seasonal challenges ("30-day challenge"), community event participation.
