## Pages

- **Services** — What you fix, with plain-language descriptions. Organized by device/product type or service category. Include what you don't repair to save everyone's time.
- **Pricing / estimates** — Flat-rate services if applicable, "starting at" ranges, free estimate policy. Transparency is the #1 trust builder in repair. People fear being overcharged.
- **About** — Experience, certifications, philosophy. Many repair businesses are one person with deep expertise — tell that story. If the business is motivated by Right to Repair values, say so.
- **Before & after / gallery** — Photos of repairs, restorations, and recoveries. Especially powerful for auto body, furniture, and electronics.
- **Warranty / guarantee** — What's covered, for how long. A repair warranty signals confidence in the work.
- **Hours / location** — Drop-off and pickup hours, parking, accessibility. If mobile/on-site repair, note the service area.
- **Testimonials** — Reviews are critical for repair businesses. People search for a repair shop when something is broken — they need trust fast.
- **FAQ** — Common questions: turnaround times, whether to repair vs. replace, data safety (electronics), what to do before bringing it in.
- **Blog** — Maintenance tips, repair guides, Right to Repair news
- **Contact** — Phone (people call when something breaks), email, drop-off instructions

## Design

**Visual mood:** Trustworthy, practical, competent. The site should feel like handing your broken item to someone who knows exactly what they're doing. Similar to trades but more focused on specific items — precision and care, not brute force.

**Color direction:** Navy, dark green, or dark gray paired with white. Grounded, professional palette. One clear accent color for CTAs (request estimate, drop off). Avoid flashy or trendy colors — repair customers want reliability, not novelty.

**Typography feel:** Modern stack (system-ui sans-serif). Medium-bold headings (600–700). Clean and readable. Body text at 1rem–1.125rem for easy scanning of service lists and pricing.

**Layout emphasis:** "What we fix" and contact info (phone, drop-off hours) prominent above the fold. Trust signals — experience, warranty, reviews — visible on the home page. Use Pattern 2 (hero + content) for home, Pattern 4 (card grid) for services organized by item type. Max-width 56rem.

**Photography style:** Before/after repair photos are the most compelling content. Clean workshop shots, tools of the trade, finished work. Authentic over polished. 4:3 aspect ratio for project photos.

**Key component:** Repair service list — item types (phones, appliances, bikes, etc.), typical turnaround time, and pricing ranges ("starting at" or flat-rate). Organized by category with clear visual separation.

## Compliance

- **Right to Repair laws**: Landscape is changing fast. As of 2025, several US states and the EU have enacted repair legislation requiring manufacturers to provide parts, tools, and documentation. If the business advocates for Right to Repair, feature this on the about page — it's a differentiator and a values statement.
- **Auto repair**: Many states require a posted repair estimate before work begins, written authorization for work exceeding the estimate, and return of replaced parts on request. Display your license number (required in most states). BAR (Bureau of Automotive Repair) registration in California.
- **Electronics/data**: If handling devices with personal data (phones, laptops), note your data privacy practices. Customers worry about data theft. State clearly: "We do not access personal data during repairs" or describe your data handling policy.
- **Environmental**: Auto body (paint, solvents), electronics (e-waste), and appliance repair (refrigerants) all have environmental regulations. Mention responsible disposal practices if applicable.
- **Warranty disclaimers**: Be clear about what the repair warranty covers and what voids it (e.g., subsequent water damage on a phone screen repair). Display warranty terms on the website.
- **Licensing**: Auto repair, HVAC, and some appliance repair require specific trade licenses. Display license numbers in the footer.
