## Pages

- **Services** — Dry cleaning, wash-and-fold, self-service, alterations, specialty items (wedding gowns, leather, drapes). Pricing per item or per pound.
- **Pricing** — Prices for common items (shirt, pants, suit, dress, comforter). Transparency avoids sticker shock at pickup.
- **Pickup & delivery** — Service area, schedule, minimum order, how it works. Pickup/delivery is a growing differentiator.
- **Hours & location** — Drop-off/pickup hours (often different from self-service hours). Parking, accessibility, machine availability.
- **Specials** — Loyalty programs, first-time discounts, bulk pricing. Laundry is a repeat business — loyalty matters.

- **FAQ** — Turnaround times, stain treatment, how to handle delicates, what can't be dry cleaned.
- **Contact** — Phone, email, pickup scheduling.

## Design

**Visual mood:** Clean, efficient, modern. The site should feel crisp and organized — like freshly pressed clothes. No fuss, no clutter. Customers want to know services, prices, and hours fast.

**Color direction:** Crisp blues and whites as the foundation, with fresh accents (light teal, soft green, or a bright pop for CTAs). Clean and hygienic feeling. Avoid dark or heavy palettes. The design should feel as fresh as the laundry.

**Typography feel:** Modern stack (system-ui sans-serif). Clean and minimal — regular to medium weight (400–500) for body, medium-bold for headings. No decorative fonts. Straightforward and scannable.

**Layout emphasis:** Services, pricing, and hours prominent above the fold. Customers visit for practical information — give it to them immediately. Use Pattern 2 (hero + content) for home. Keep pages short and focused. Max-width 52rem.

**Photography style:** Clean, bright facility photos — machines, folding area, the storefront. Show the space looking its best. For pickup/delivery services, show the process. 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio. Authentic but well-lit.

**Key component:** Pricing table — service type (dry cleaning, wash-and-fold, self-service), turnaround time, and price per item or per pound. Clear columns, easy to scan, updated when prices change.

## Tools

- **Starchup** (pricing varies, proprietary) — Dry cleaning POS, pickup/delivery management, customer portal. starchup.com

## Compliance

- **Environmental (PERC)**: Perchloroethylene (PERC) is the traditional dry cleaning solvent and is heavily regulated. EPA, state, and local agencies regulate air emissions, wastewater, and disposal. If using alternative solvents (hydrocarbon, liquid CO2, wet cleaning), promote it — it's a selling point.
- **Environmental cleanup liability**: Dry cleaning sites are common EPA Superfund and state brownfield sites due to historical PERC contamination. Not a website issue, but impacts insurance and property.
- **Fire codes**: Laundromats with gas dryers must comply with local fire codes. Self-service facilities have occupancy and safety requirements.
- **ADA**: Self-service facilities must be ADA accessible — aisles, machine heights, accessible payment.
- **Sales tax**: Laundry services are taxable in some states, exempt in others. Varies by service type (self-service vs. drop-off).
- **Lost/damaged garments**: Have a clear policy for handling lost or damaged items. Display or link to your terms of service.
