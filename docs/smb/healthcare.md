## Design

**Visual mood:** Calming, trustworthy, clinical but warm. The design should lower anxiety — patients visiting a healthcare site are often stressed or in pain. Clean and reassuring.

**Color direction:** Soft blues, greens, and white. Light, airy backgrounds. Warm accents (soft gold, sage) to avoid feeling sterile. Avoid harsh reds or high-contrast patterns. The palette should feel clean without feeling cold.

**Typography feel:** Humanist stack (Segoe UI / Roboto) for warmth and readability. Heading weight 600. Approachable and clear — healthcare content must be easy to read for all literacy levels.

**Layout emphasis:** Patient portal link and online booking CTA above the fold — these are the #1 and #2 reasons people visit. Provider bios with photos build trust before the first visit. Insurance/payment info should be easy to find. Use Pattern 2 (hero + content) for home. Max-width 56rem.

**Photography style:** Clean, bright, natural-light photography. Real office and provider photos are far better than stock. Warm and welcoming — show the space patients will actually visit. Avoid clinical stock photos with stethoscopes and clipboards.

**Key component:** Provider bio card — professional photo, name, title/credentials, specialties, brief personal note, and "book with this provider" link. Patients choose providers, not practices.

## Tools

- **Jane App** (~$55/mo, proprietary) — Practice management, online booking, charting, insurance billing. Purpose-built for health and wellness. janeapp.com
- **Cal.com** (open source, free tier) — Simple appointment scheduling if they don't need practice management.
- **SimplePractice** (~$29/mo, proprietary) — Popular with therapists and counselors. Includes telehealth, billing, client portal.
- For patient forms: link to their existing EHR/portal. Don't build patient intake into the website.

## Compliance

- **HIPAA (US)**: The website itself isn't a HIPAA concern — it's public information. But do NOT collect patient health information through website forms. Contact forms should only collect name, phone, and reason for visit (not symptoms or diagnoses). Link to a HIPAA-compliant patient portal for intake forms.
- **No medical advice disclaimers**: Blog content should include a general disclaimer that it's informational, not medical advice.
- **Veterinary**: Less regulatory burden on the website, but still avoid collecting patient (animal) health records through forms.
- **Testimonials**: Some jurisdictions restrict healthcare testimonials. Note this during the design interview.
