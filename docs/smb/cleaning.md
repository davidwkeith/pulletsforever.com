# Cleaning Service

Covers: residential cleaning (housekeeping, maid service), commercial/janitorial, move-in/move-out cleaning, post-construction cleaning, carpet cleaning, window cleaning, pressure washing.

## Pages

- **Services** — Residential, commercial, deep clean, move-in/move-out, recurring (weekly/biweekly/monthly). Be specific about what's included in each — customers need to know what "standard clean" means.
- **Pricing** — Starting rates, flat rate vs. hourly, how quotes work. Transparency reduces phone calls from poor-fit leads.
- **Booking** — Online booking or quote request. Include home size, frequency, and special requests.
- **About** — Story, values, why you started. Cleaning businesses enter people's homes — trust is everything. Background checks, bonding, insurance should be front and center.
- **Service area** — Map or list. Cleaning is hyperlocal.
- **Testimonials** — Reviews from verified customers. Before/after photos.
- **Checklist** — What's included in each service tier. Customers love checklists — it sets expectations.
- **FAQ** — Do I need to be home? What products do you use? Do you bring your own supplies? How do I prepare? Cancellation policy?
- **Contact** — Phone, email, booking link.

## Design

**Visual mood:** Clean, bright, fresh. The design should embody the service — when someone lands on the page, it should feel like a room that was just cleaned. Airy, uncluttered, and inviting.

**Color direction:** Light palette — whites, light blues, fresh greens, touches of lemon. Crisp and sparkling. Avoid dark or heavy backgrounds. Accent color for booking CTAs should pop against the light base.

**Typography feel:** Modern stack (system-ui sans-serif). Clean weight (400–500) for body, medium weight for headings. Light and breathable. Generous line-height. The typography should feel as tidy as the service.

**Layout emphasis:** Before/after photos and booking CTA prominent above the fold. Service tiers with clear "what's included" checklists. Use Pattern 2 (hero + content) for home, Pattern 5 (alternating features) for before/after showcase sections. Max-width 56rem.

**Photography style:** Bright, well-lit before/after shots are the strongest content. Natural light, clean compositions. Show the transformation. 16:9 for before/after comparisons (side by side). Facility and team photos should feel warm and professional.

**Key component:** Before/after photo slider or side-by-side comparison — showing the cleaning transformation. Each pair with a brief caption (room type, service performed). On desktop, side by side; on mobile, stacked with clear "before" and "after" labels.

## Tools

- **Jobber** (~$40+/mo, proprietary) — Scheduling, quoting, invoicing, client management, GPS tracking. jobber.com
- **ZenMaid** (~$49+/mo, proprietary) — Built specifically for maid services. Scheduling, booking, client management. zenmaid.com
- **Launch27 / BookingKoala** (~$70+/mo, proprietary) — Online booking, automated pricing, recurring schedules.
- **Square** (free POS, proprietary) — Invoicing and payments for smaller operations.
- **Cal.com** (open source, free tier) — Estimate scheduling.
- Many cleaning businesses run on a phone, a calendar, and a payment app. If volume is under 10 clients/week, that's fine.

## Compliance

- **Bonding and insurance**: General liability insurance and a surety bond protect the client and the business. Display "Licensed, bonded, and insured" prominently — it's the #1 trust signal.
- **Employee vs. contractor**: Cleaning businesses frequently misclassify workers as 1099 contractors. This is an IRS and state labor law issue. Not a website item, but if the business mentions "our team," they should be W-2 employees or this creates liability.
- **Cleaning product safety**: If advertising "green" or "non-toxic" cleaning, be truthful. EPA Safer Choice certification exists. Don't make health claims about cleaning products.
- **Background checks**: If entering homes, state clearly that employees are background-checked.
- **Service agreements**: Terms of service should cover cancellation, lockouts, breakage, and scope of work.
