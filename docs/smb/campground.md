# Campground & RV Park

Covers: RV parks, campgrounds, glamping sites, tent-only campgrounds, seasonal/long-term RV parks, KOA or franchise campgrounds (independent), county/municipal campgrounds.

## Pages

- **Sites / rates** — Site types (full hookup, water/electric, dry camping, tent, cabin, glamping), rates by season, weekly/monthly rates, site maps. Include hookup details (30/50 amp, water, sewer, WiFi). This is the most important page — campers compare parks almost entirely on sites, rates, and amenities.
- **Amenities** — Pool, showers, laundry, camp store, playground, dog park, dump station, WiFi, fire rings, picnic tables. Be specific about what's included and what costs extra.
- **Reservations** — Online booking link, cancellation policy, deposit requirements, minimum stay, check-in/out times, quiet hours, arrival instructions.
- **Park map** — Downloadable or interactive site map showing site numbers, amenities, roads, trails. Campers want to pick their spot.
- **Activities & area** — On-site activities (fishing, hiking trails, recreation room, events) and nearby attractions. Seasonal activity calendar.
- **Rules / policies** — Pet policy (breed restrictions, leash rules), quiet hours, speed limits, fire rules (burn ban awareness), generator hours, guest/visitor policy. Campground rules are detailed — put them on the website to avoid surprises.
- **About** — Park history, owners, community feel. Many campgrounds are family-run and multi-generational.
- **Gallery** — Photos of sites (empty and occupied), amenities, views, seasonal shots. Drone/aerial views are especially useful for showing the park layout.
- **Seasonal / long-term** — If offering monthly or seasonal rates, give this its own page: rates, what's included, application process, waiting list.
- **Contact** — Phone, email, office hours, after-hours check-in instructions.

## Design

**Visual mood:** Outdoorsy, natural, adventurous but family-friendly. The site should feel like opening the tent flap to a beautiful morning — fresh air, trees, open sky. Inviting to both experienced campers and first-timers.

**Color direction:** Earth greens, sky blues, warm browns. Muted natural palette. White or cream background. Green as primary, warm brown or gold as accent. Avoid anything urban or synthetic.

**Typography feel:** Humanist stack (Segoe UI/Roboto) for a friendly, approachable feel. Heading weight 600–700. Clean and readable — campers are often browsing on phones with outdoor glare.

**Layout emphasis:** Availability and booking above the fold — can I get a site this weekend? Home page uses Pattern 2 (hero + content) with a scenic park photo. Site types use Pattern 4 (card grid) for easy comparison. Park map prominently linked. Max-width 56rem.

**Photography style:** Landscape photography — nature, campsites (empty and occupied), amenities, activities, views. Drone and aerial shots show the park layout. 16:9 for hero images, 4:3 for site and amenity photos. Golden hour and blue hour shots. Seasonal variety.

**Key component:** Campsite type card — photo of a representative site, site type name, description, amenities icons (hookups, fire ring, picnic table, shade), and rate. Clear comparison between site types helps campers choose.

## Tools

- **Campspot** (pricing varies, proprietary) — Campground reservation system: online booking, site management, dynamic pricing. campspot.com
- **Firefly Reservations** (~$75+/mo, proprietary) — Reservation management built for campgrounds and RV parks. fireflyreservations.com
- **RoverPass** (pricing varies, proprietary) — Online reservations, marketplace listing, campground management. roverpass.com
- **Campground Master** (one-time fee, proprietary) — Desktop-based reservation system. Popular with smaller parks. campgroundmaster.com
- **Square** (free POS, proprietary) — Camp store, firewood sales, on-site purchases.
- Many small campgrounds still take reservations by phone and manage sites on a paper grid or spreadsheet. If it works and the volume is manageable, that's fine.

## Compliance

- **Health department**: Campgrounds with public facilities (showers, restrooms, pools, water systems) are regulated by state and local health departments. Display your license. Inspections are routine. Water system testing (for campgrounds on well water) is often required.
- **Fire safety**: Fire bans, burn regulations, and fire ring requirements vary by region and season. Note current fire conditions on the website during fire season. Some jurisdictions require fire extinguishers at each site or in common areas.
- **Utility connections**: If providing utility hookups (electric, water, sewer), electrical must meet code. 30/50 amp service must be properly wired and inspected. Sewer connections must comply with local sanitation regulations.
- **Occupancy / zoning**: Campgrounds are zoned differently from residential or commercial. Seasonal parks may have occupancy limits on how many days per year a guest can stay. Some jurisdictions restrict year-round residency.
- **ADA**: Campgrounds must provide accessible sites, restrooms, and pathways under ADA. Note which sites and facilities are accessible.
- **Liquor licensing**: If selling alcohol in the camp store, state and local licensing applies.
- **Liability / waivers**: Many campgrounds use activity waivers (pool, playground, trails). Note liability limitations in the rules page.
- **Environmental**: Parks near waterways, wetlands, or protected land may have environmental regulations regarding runoff, waste, and land use.
