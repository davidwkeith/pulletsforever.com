# Small Business Type Reference

Industry-specific guidance for the webmaster agent. Each file covers one business type with pages, tools, compliance, content, and data tracking recommendations.

## How to use

1. Read `BUSINESS_TYPE` from `.site-config` (may be comma-separated for multi-mode businesses).
2. Read the matching file from this directory.
3. When the SMB file's Tools section mentions a shared platform (Square, Cal.com, Google Business Profile, Buttondown, Mailchimp, Yelp, TripAdvisor, HoneyBook, Ko-fi, The Knot), read the matching file from `docs/platforms/` for setup and integration guidance.
4. Apply recommendations during `/anglesite:start`, `/anglesite:design-interview`, and ongoing content planning.

Only read the file(s) relevant to the owner's business type. Don't load all files — keep context focused.

These files are reference material for the agent, not user-facing documentation.

| [pre-launch.md](pre-launch.md) | Adjustments for businesses that haven't launched yet. | `/anglesite:start` if pre-launch |

## Pre-launch businesses

Not every owner has an established business. Some are just starting out — no name, no customers, just an idea. See [pre-launch.md](pre-launch.md) for how to adjust `/anglesite:start`, what to build, and free resources to share.

## Multi-mode businesses

Most businesses span multiple types. See [multi-mode.md](multi-mode.md) for how to merge guidance. Key rules:

- `BUSINESS_TYPE` in `.site-config` supports comma-separated values (primary type first)
- Read the SMB doc for each type and merge: pages are unioned, compliance is additive, tools avoid duplication
- One website, one nav — secondary modes are sections, not separate sites

## Out of scope

Some business types need more than a static site scaffold can provide. If someone asks, acknowledge that Anglesite isn't the right fit and point them to appropriate resources:

- **Local newspapers / media outlets** — Need a CMS built for journalism (article workflows, breaking news, paywall, advertising). Consider Ghost, WordPress with Flavor, or custom solutions. May be supported in a future version.

## Structure of each file

Every file follows the same format:

1. **Pages** — Priority pages for this business type
2. **Tools** — Industry-specific SaaS recommendations (following the SaaS criteria)
3. **Compliance** — Legal or regulatory considerations
4. **Content ideas** — What to post about
5. **Key dates** — Industry-specific awareness days and seasonal hooks
6. **Structured data** — JSON-LD schema type and properties
7. **Data tracking** — Suggested tables and fields for the business type
