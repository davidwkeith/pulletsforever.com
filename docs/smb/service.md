# Service Business

Covers: consultants, coaches (business, life, executive), freelancers, virtual assistants, bookkeepers, event planners, marketing agencies, and other client-based service businesses. See also [trades.md](trades.md) for physical trades, [cleaning.md](cleaning.md) for cleaning services, [education.md](education.md) for teaching/tutoring, and [legal.md](legal.md) / [accounting.md](accounting.md) for licensed professions.

## Pages

- **Services** — Individual pages or sections per service offering. Clear descriptions of what's included, who it's for, and what the outcome is. Avoid jargon. Price ranges or "starting at" figures reduce tire-kicker inquiries.
- **About** — Credentials, experience, and personality. Clients hire the person. Include a real photo and a human bio alongside professional qualifications.
- **Process** — How an engagement works, step by step. "Here's what to expect" reduces anxiety for first-time buyers. First call → proposal → kickoff → delivery → follow-up.
- **Testimonials / case studies** — Results-focused. "Before working with [name], we had X problem. After, we achieved Y." Anonymize if needed, but get permission for named testimonials.
- **Blog** — Demonstrate expertise by answering the questions clients ask before they hire. This is the #1 search traffic driver for service businesses.
- **Book / schedule** — Link to Cal.com, Calendly, or a contact form. Reduce friction — every click between "I'm interested" and "I booked a call" loses people.
- **Contact** — Email, phone, scheduling link. Include timezone and response time expectations ("I respond within 24 hours").
- **Resources** — Templates, guides, checklists, tools the owner recommends. Builds authority and gives visitors a reason to return.

## Design

**Visual mood:** Clean, professional, and adaptable. Service businesses vary widely — the design should feel competent and polished without being locked to any one industry aesthetic.

**Color direction:** Adaptable palette based on the specific service type. Neutrals (white, warm gray, charcoal) as a foundation with one or two accent colors that reflect the owner's personality and field. Consultants can go bolder than bookkeepers. Avoid overly corporate palettes for solo practitioners.

**Typography feel:** Modern stack (system-ui) for a clean, contemporary look. Heading weight 600–700. Professional and current. The typography should feel confident without being heavy-handed.

**Layout emphasis:** Clear service descriptions and a booking CTA are the core conversion path. The "process" page reduces buyer anxiety — make it prominent. Blog content drives search traffic and demonstrates expertise. Use Pattern 2 (hero + content) for home, Pattern 4 (card grid) for services. Max-width 56rem.

**Photography style:** Professional headshot of the owner is essential — clients hire the person. Natural, approachable, well-lit. Workspace or in-action photos add authenticity. Avoid generic stock. If using lifestyle photography, it should reflect the actual client base.

**Key component:** Service card — service name, brief description, who it's for, outcome, and CTA ("book a call" or "learn more"). Each card should help a prospect self-select into the right service.

## Compliance

- **Contracts**: Always use a written agreement. Scope of work, payment terms, cancellation policy, intellectual property ownership. Templates from SCORE or SBA are a starting point.
- **Professional licensing**: Some services require licenses (financial advising, certain coaching certifications, bookkeeping in some states). Check state requirements.
- **Insurance**: General liability at minimum. Professional liability (errors & omissions) for advice-based businesses. Required by some clients before engagement.
- **Tax obligations**: Service income is self-employment income (Schedule C). Quarterly estimated taxes apply.
- **Non-compete / non-disclosure**: If working with business clients, understand confidentiality obligations. Don't share client information on the website without permission.
