## Pages

- **Services** — What they do, service descriptions in plain language
- **Service area** — Map or list of cities/neighborhoods served. Critical for local SEO.
- **Gallery / projects** — Before/after photos of completed work
- **About** — Experience, philosophy, team, story
- **Testimonials** — Client reviews (especially important for trust in home services)
- **Licensing / insurance** — License numbers, bonded/insured status. Builds trust.
- **Free estimate / contact** — Phone number prominent, contact form for estimate requests
- **Blog** — Maintenance tips, seasonal checklists, project spotlights

## Design

**Visual mood:** Dependable, straightforward, professional. The site should feel like a firm handshake — confident without being flashy. Trust signals (licensing, insurance, reviews) matter more than visual flair.

**Color direction:** Strong, grounded colors — navy, dark green, dark gray, or a bold primary (red, orange, blue) with white. Industrial palette. Avoid pastels or overly corporate blues. One bold accent for CTAs (call now, get a quote).

**Typography feel:** Modern stack (system-ui sans-serif). Medium to bold heading weight (600–700). Straightforward and readable. No decorative fonts. Slightly larger body text (1.125rem) for readability — many visitors are on phones at a job site.

**Layout emphasis:** Phone number and "Get a Quote" above the fold on every page. Service areas clearly listed. Trust signals (licensed, insured, years in business) prominent. Use Pattern 2 (hero + content) for home, Pattern 1 (single column) for service pages. Max-width 56rem.

**Photography style:** Real job photos — before/after transformations, team on site, equipment, finished work. Candid and authentic beats polished studio shots. Smartphone photos are fine if well-lit. 4:3 or 16:9 for project galleries.

**Key component:** Service area list with "areas we serve" as a clear section. Before/after photo pairs for completed projects — side by side on desktop, stacked on mobile.

## Compliance

- **Licensing display**: Most jurisdictions require contractors to display their license number on advertising, including websites. Add to the footer on every page.
- **Bonded and insured**: Displaying this builds trust. Include policy details or a badge on the about or home page.
- **Home improvement regulations**: Some states require specific disclosures (cooling-off periods, lien rights, etc.) on contracts. Not a website concern, but worth noting if the owner handles client contracts.
- **Moving companies**: Interstate movers must register with FMCSA and display a USDOT number. Intrastate movers are regulated by the state (PUC or DOT). Display license/registration numbers. Provide written estimates (binding or non-binding). Many states have specific consumer protection rules for movers.
- **Pest control**: Requires state licensing (pesticide applicator's license). Display license number. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a selling point. Note any restrictions on chemicals used, especially for homes with children or pets.

## Content ideas

Project spotlights with before/after photos, seasonal maintenance checklists ("winterize your plumbing," "spring lawn prep"), "when to call a professional vs. DIY" guides, behind-the-scenes of a project, team member spotlights, community involvement, answers to common questions (great for SEO).
