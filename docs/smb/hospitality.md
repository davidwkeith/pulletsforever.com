## Pages

- **Rooms / rentals** — Individual pages per room or property with photos, amenities, pricing, and availability link
- **Gallery** — Professional photos of the property, views, grounds, nearby attractions
- **Location / area** — What's nearby, local attractions, restaurants, activities. Great for SEO.
- **About** — The host's story. B&Bs and small lodging are personal — guests choose the host.
- **Policies** — Check-in/out times, cancellation, pet policy, house rules
- **Rates / book** — Seasonal pricing, link to booking platform
- **Reviews / testimonials** — Guest testimonials (critical for hospitality trust)
- **Contact** — Phone, email, directions, parking instructions
- **Events** — If the venue hosts events (weddings, retreats, meetings)

## Design

**Visual mood:** Welcoming, aspirational, experience-driven. The site should make visitors picture themselves there — relaxing, exploring, arriving. Warm and polished without being sterile.

**Color direction:** Warm and inviting — creams, sage, soft blues, warm wood tones. Muted saturation. White or cream background. Avoid harsh or bright colors. The palette should feel like a comfortable room.

**Typography feel:** Classic stack (Georgia serif headings) for B&Bs and boutique hotels — conveys character and permanence. Sans-serif body for readability. Heading weight 600–700.

**Layout emphasis:** Rooms/rates and a booking CTA above the fold. Home page uses Pattern 2 (hero + content) with a stunning property photo — the first impression must be aspirational. Room pages with large photos and clear pricing. Max-width 56rem.

**Photography style:** Professional interior and exterior photography — rooms, common areas, grounds, views, nearby attractions. 16:9 for hero banners, 4:3 for room photos. Natural light, warm tones. Show the property at its best season. Real guests enjoying the space (with permission) add warmth.

**Key component:** Room or accommodation card — photo, room name, brief description, rate (or "from $X"), amenity icons, and a "Book" or "Check Availability" button. Each room should feel distinct and inviting.

## Compliance

- **ADA accommodations**: Note physical accessibility (stairs, elevator, ground-floor rooms, bathroom grab bars). Important for guest decision-making and compliance.
- **Short-term rental regulations**: Many cities now regulate short-term rentals (permits, licenses, zoning). Display the permit number if required.
