# Food Bank & Pantry

Covers: food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, meal delivery programs, community fridges.

See [nonprofit.md](nonprofit.md) for shared nonprofit traits (donate page, transparency, compliance).

## Pages

- **Get food / find help** — The most important page. Distribution locations, hours, eligibility (keep it simple — avoid bureaucratic language). No one should leave the website confused about how to get food.
- **Donate** — Money, food drives, corporate partnerships. Most food banks can turn $1 into multiple meals — state the multiplier.
- **Volunteer** — Shifts, sign-up link, what to expect, group volunteering for corporate/school groups
- **About / mission** — Impact stats, history, the need in the community
- **Programs** — Mobile pantry, home delivery, school backpack programs, senior boxes, SNAP enrollment help
- **Partner agencies** — If the org distributes through partner sites, list them with hours and addresses
- **Events** — Food drives, fundraisers, community meals, volunteer days
- **News / blog** — Impact stories, food drive results, program updates
- **Contact** — Office phone, helpline if applicable

## Design

- **Visual mood:** Warm, dignified, and community-focused. Never poverty-tourism imagery. The design must respect the people it serves.
- **Color direction:** Warm greens, oranges, and earthy browns. Approachable and grounded. Avoid clinical whites or charity-cliche reds.
- **Typography feel:** Humanist sans-serif (Segoe UI/Roboto stack). Clear and legible — many visitors may be reading on older devices or in stressful situations.
- **Layout emphasis:** Pattern 2 (hero + content) for the home page. Hours, location, and "How to Get Help" above the fold. Accessibility of information is the number one design priority — large text, clear hierarchy, minimal clutter. Max-width 48rem.
- **Photography style:** Community photos showing dignity and agency, not despair. Volunteers in action, food distribution in progress, community meals. 4:3 aspect ratio. Warm, natural lighting.
- **Key component:** Location and hours finder — clear, large text, easy to scan on any device. If multiple distribution sites exist, each one gets its own entry with address, hours, and what to bring.

## Compliance

- **USDA requirements**: If receiving USDA commodities (TEFAP), display the USDA nondiscrimination statement and complaint process on the website. This is federally required.
- **Client privacy**: Never display client names, photos, or identifiable information without explicit consent. Food insecurity carries stigma — protect dignity.
- **Allergen info**: If distributing prepared meals, note common allergens.
- **Good Samaritan Act**: Food donors are protected from liability. Mention this on the "donate food" page to encourage donations.

## Content ideas
