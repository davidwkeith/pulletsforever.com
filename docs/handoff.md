# Website Handoff

How to transfer the website to another person — a new developer, a new owner, or a different platform. Reference for the webmaster agent. Applied when the owner asks about transferring, selling the business, or sunsetting the site.

## What the owner controls

The owner owns everything. There is no platform lock-in, no proprietary code, no vendor dependency. The full inventory:

| Asset | Where it lives | How to transfer |
|---|---|---|
| Website code and content | Local project folder (and cloud backup if configured) | Copy the folder |
| Git history | `.git/` directory inside the project folder | Included when copying the folder |
| Domain name | Cloudflare Registrar (or owner's registrar) | Domain transfer or nameserver change |
| Cloudflare Pages project | Owner's Cloudflare account | Add the new person as a Cloudflare member, or redeploy from their own account |
| DNS records | Cloudflare DNS | Export/recreate in new DNS provider |
| Email routing | Cloudflare or email provider (iCloud+, Fastmail, etc.) | Reconfigure with new provider |
| Cloudflare Analytics | Owner's Cloudflare account | Not transferable (historical data stays with the account) |
| Google Business Profile | Owner's Google account | Transfer ownership in Google Business Profile settings |
| Apple Business Connect | Owner's Apple account | Transfer in Apple Business Connect settings |
| Content in Keystatic | `.mdx` files in `src/content/` | Included in the website folder |
| Blog images | `public/images/` | Included in the website folder |
| Site configuration | `.site-config` | Included in the website folder |
| Airtable data (if used) | Owner's Airtable account | Export to CSV, or transfer Airtable workspace |

## Transferring to another developer

The most common scenario — the owner wants someone else to manage the site.

### What to give them

1. **The website folder** — The entire project directory. This contains everything needed to build, run, and deploy the site. Copy it via AirDrop, USB drive, or zip and email.
2. **Cloudflare access** — Add the developer as a member on the Cloudflare account with appropriate permissions (not Super Administrator). Go to: Cloudflare dashboard → Manage Account → Members → Invite.
3. **Git access** — If the project is on GitLab (or GitHub), add the developer as a member. If it's local-only, the folder copy is the repository.
4. **Domain registrar access** — If the domain is on Cloudflare, the Cloudflare member invitation covers it. If it's on a separate registrar, add the developer as an authorized contact.
5. **`.site-config` contents** — This file contains project name, domain, email, and API keys (if any). It's in the website folder already.

### What they need to know

The new developer needs to understand:

- **How to run locally:** `npm install && npm run ai-setup && npm run dev` — runs with HTTPS at the hostname configured in `.site-config`. The setup script installs mkcert, generates a locally-trusted certificate, updates the hosts file, and configures port forwarding (443 → 4321). Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. See `docs/local-https.md`.
- **How to build:** `npm run build`
- **How to deploy:** `npx wrangler pages deploy dist/ --project-name PROJECT_NAME`
- **How to edit content:** Keystatic at `https://DEV_HOSTNAME/keystatic` while the dev server is running (read `DEV_HOSTNAME` from `.site-config`)
- **Where the docs are:** `docs/` contains all architecture and reference documentation
- **Where the commands are:** Commands are provided by the Anglesite plugin (skills like `/anglesite:start`, `/anglesite:deploy`, etc.)

### What NOT to share

- **Owner's Cloudflare password** — Use member invitations instead
- **Owner's email password** — The developer doesn't need email access
- **Owner's personal Apple ID or Google account** — Transfer Google Business Profile ownership separately

## Transferring to a new business owner

If the business is sold, the website usually goes with it.

### Step 1: Domain transfer

The new owner needs their own Cloudflare account. Transfer the domain:

1. New owner creates a free Cloudflare account
2. Current owner: unlock the domain at the registrar and get the EPP/transfer code
3. New owner: initiate transfer at Cloudflare dashboard → Domains → Transfer
4. Current owner: approve the transfer confirmation email
5. Transfer completes (usually hours, can take up to 5 days)

### Step 2: Cloudflare Pages project

Option A (simplest): Add the new owner to the existing Cloudflare account, then remove the old owner.

Option B (clean break): New owner creates a new Cloudflare Pages project and deploys from their own copy of the website folder.

### Step 3: Other accounts

Transfer ownership of:
- Google Business Profile (Settings → Managers → Transfer primary ownership)
- Apple Business Connect
- Social media accounts
- Email service (if using custom domain email)
- Booking platform, payment processor, etc.
- Airtable workspace (if used)

### Step 4: Website folder

Give the new owner:
- The complete project folder
- Instructions for running it (the README in the folder covers this)
- Any passwords or API keys stored in `.env` or `.site-config`

### Step 5: Update the site

The new owner should update:
- Business name, address, phone (if changed) — see `docs/smb/info-changes.md`
- About page with new ownership story
- Privacy policy with new contact info
- Copyright notice

## Migrating to a different platform

If the owner wants to move to WordPress, Squarespace, or another platform:

### What they keep

- **Domain** — Transfer the domain to whatever DNS/registrar the new platform requires
- **Content** — All blog posts are `.mdx` files in `src/content/posts/`. The content is plain text with simple formatting — easy to copy into any CMS
- **Images** — All in `public/images/`. Copy to the new platform
- **Structured data** — The JSON-LD can be copied to any platform
- **Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, social media** — These are independent of the website platform

### What they lose

- **Site design** — The CSS and layout are custom. A new platform means a new design.
- **Zero-cost hosting** — Most platforms charge monthly fees
- **Privacy-first defaults** — Most platforms inject tracking scripts, third-party fonts, and cookies
- **Cloudflare security headers** — Would need to be reconfigured on the new platform
- **Git version history** — Meaningful only for developers

### Redirect plan

If the URL structure changes on the new platform, set up redirects so existing links don't break:

- Old blog post URLs should redirect to new ones (301 redirect)
- Old page URLs should redirect to their equivalents
- Google Search Console should be updated with the new sitemap

## Sunsetting a website

If the owner is closing the business and doesn't need the website anymore:

### Option A: Keep it up as an archive

- Leave the site running on Cloudflare Pages (free, no maintenance required)
- Update the home page: "Thank you for [X] years. [Business name] is now closed."
- Keep the domain active so the URL doesn't go to a squatter
- Cost: ~$10/year for the domain

### Option B: Take it down

1. **Cancel the domain auto-renewal** — Let it expire (or actively delete it at the registrar). Warning: the domain will become available for anyone to buy. Domain squatters buy expired business domains and put spam or scam sites on them.
2. **Delete the Cloudflare Pages project** — Dashboard → Pages → Project → Settings → Delete
3. **Update Google Business Profile** — Mark the business as "permanently closed"
4. **Update Apple Business Connect** — Same
5. **Keep a local backup** — The project folder is a complete archive. The owner can rebuild the site from it at any time.

### Option C: Redirect to social media

If the owner is closing but maintains a social media presence:
- Set up a redirect from the domain to their social profile
- This keeps the domain active (no squatters) and directs any remaining traffic

## Backup strategy

Regardless of handoff scenario, the owner should always have:

1. **A copy of the project folder** — On their computer (and cloud backup if the folder is in iCloud Drive or another synced location)
2. **Access credentials written down** — Cloudflare login, domain registrar, 2FA recovery codes (see `docs/security.md` → Recovery plan)
3. **A recent successful build** — Run `npm run build` before any handoff to verify the site builds correctly

The project folder is the complete source of truth. If the owner has that folder, they can recreate everything.
