# Cloudflare

## Pages project

- Project name: stored in `.site-config` as `CF_PROJECT_NAME` (set during first `/anglesite:deploy`)
- Deploy command: `npx wrangler pages deploy dist/ --project-name CF_PROJECT_NAME`
- First deploy triggers OAuth in browser (Sign in with Apple)

## Custom domain

Configured during `/anglesite:deploy` after the first publish. Stored in `.site-config` as `SITE_DOMAIN`.

### Domain options (handled during first `/anglesite:deploy`)

**Buy a new domain** — Cloudflare Registrar sells domains at cost (no markup). Search and purchase at `dash.cloudflare.com → Domains → Register`. Payment method required on Cloudflare account.

**Transfer an existing domain** — Move a domain from another registrar to Cloudflare. Requires: domain unlocked at current registrar, authorization/EPP code. Transfers extend registration by 1 year. Usually completes within hours, can take up to 5 days.

**Point an existing domain** — Keep the domain at its current registrar but use Cloudflare's nameservers for DNS. The webmaster adds the domain via the Cloudflare API and tells the owner which nameservers to set at their current registrar. Propagation usually takes minutes, can take up to 48 hours.

### DNS management

All DNS records are managed by the webmaster via the Cloudflare API (`npx wrangler auth token` + REST API). The owner is never asked to add, remove, or modify DNS records directly. The webmaster explains what will be done and why before each change, and confirms what was done after.

Typical configuration after domain is on Cloudflare:
- CNAME `www` → `project-name.pages.dev` (auto-created when custom domain is added to Pages project via API)
- SSL certificate: provisioned automatically (free)
- Email records (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC) added via `/anglesite:domain`
- Verification records (Bluesky, Google) added via `/anglesite:domain`

## Web Analytics

Enabled on the Pages project. Cloudflare auto-injects the beacon script. No additional configuration needed. Privacy-first: no cookies, no personal data collected.

Dashboard: `https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/web-analytics`

## MCP

The Cloudflare MCP is provided by the Claude.ai built-in integration (claude.ai Cloudflare Developer Platform). No local `.mcp.json` needed — it's always available when using Claude Code with a claude.ai account.

## Staging previews

Wrangler supports branch deploys. Deploy to a non-production branch to get a preview URL:

```sh
npx wrangler pages deploy dist/ --project-name CF_PROJECT_NAME --branch preview
```

This creates `preview.CF_PROJECT_NAME.pages.dev`. The preview is not indexed by search engines and is separate from the production deploy.

Use previews for:
- First-time review before going live
- Testing major changes before publishing
- Showing the owner changes before they're public

## Rollback

If a deploy breaks something:

**Quick rollback via Cloudflare dashboard:**
1. Open the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to **Workers & Pages** → your project → **Deployments**
3. Find the last working deploy
4. Click **Rollback to this deploy**

This instantly reverts the live site. The broken code is still in git — you'll need to fix it and redeploy.

**Rollback via git:**
If the issue is in a recent commit, use git revert to undo it, then rebuild and redeploy:

```sh
git revert HEAD
```

```sh
npm run build
```

```sh
npx wrangler pages deploy dist/ --project-name CF_PROJECT_NAME
```

**When to use which:**
- **Dashboard rollback** — Immediate fix, site is down or broken, need it fixed in seconds
- **Git revert** — The code change caused the issue, you want a clean history

## Security headers

Defined in `public/_headers`. Applied to all routes:
- `Content-Security-Policy` — only self + Cloudflare Insights
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` — blocks camera, microphone, geolocation, payment, interest-cohort

## Troubleshooting

- **Deploy fails:** Check `~/.anglesite/logs/deploy.log`. Common: Wrangler auth expired → `npx wrangler login`
- **Site not updating:** Cloudflare cache. Wait 1–2 minutes or purge cache in dashboard.
- **DNS not resolving:** Propagation can take up to 48 hours (usually minutes). Check nameserver configuration.
- **Domain transfer stuck:** Check email for transfer confirmation from previous registrar. Some registrars require manual approval.
- **SSL not working:** Cloudflare provisions SSL automatically. If it shows "pending", wait 15 minutes. Check that the domain's DNS is proxied (orange cloud icon in Cloudflare DNS settings).
- **CSP errors in console:** A script or style is loading from an unapproved domain. Check `_headers`.
